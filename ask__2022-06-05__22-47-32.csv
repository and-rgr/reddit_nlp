What do you think caused Donald Trump to have a below average IQ?,lwb5gr,1,0.55,1614715417,1654469252,"I mean I'm disgusted at people on quora thinking that his IQ is average or above average, but then stating things in their comments that suggests that he has below average intelligence. The problem is that people think that people of average intelligence are dumb, which is not the case. In high school my school psychologist showed me exactly where all of his testees scored on the WISC-V assessment. He said that most of the people scored in the 90-115 range (just like the curve would suggest), with some scoring in the 115-130 range and a couple scoring in the 70-85 range. 

Average intelligence is enough to understand economics, the nauces of governance, science, etc. It's enough for the job as president. I know 99% of the people at my local community college could be able to somewhat easily understand the vast nuances of governance and economics if they're inclined to do so, and they could be able to do the job of a president overall very well. This is from experience as a student (now a 20 year old sophomore) at a local community college. I took microeconomics and macroeconomics and many other classes and discovered that 99% of the people aren't at all slow, and I'm sure that less than 20% of the students I met have a IQ in the gifted range.  I tested a IQ of 100 and I know another student tested a IQ of 93 and from what I observed neither I nor the other students really struggle with calculus or the soft sciences (usually being president requires a ability to be able to understand and apply concepts in the soft sciences, which is definitely in the range of ability for a person with at least average intelligence). Usually the school environment is mainly tailored for those people with average intelligence (even at certain colleges) and gifted people would actually suffer at a community college or regular school. In other words, it's possible that Biden and Obama and Clinton and Bush isn't all that much smarter than the average person or even a majority of the population. Average intelligence is still intelligent, just not as intelligent as someone whose gifted. 

It's not that Biden, or Bush is particularly intelligent (means above average intelligence), it's just that they're smarter as compared to Trump (but that's only because Trump set a very low bar). Would they have been considered intelligent if the bar is set higher (like at the level of that of a gifted person?), not necessarily. 

If most people can be able to see why Trump's decisions are stupid or bad, but Trump himself can't see it it suggests that Trump is of below average intelligence. I have heard of psychologists putting his IQ in the 70-80 range (most people are in average range with a couple in the above average range). 

I mean I know I might sound rude, but I'm making a point. Trump is probably not of average intelligence.

A IQ in the range of 70-80 is known as borderline mental disability, or borderline intellectual functioning.  It usually has a cause. Most people in this range could actually have no problems with speaking or activities of daily functioning, they just struggle with cognitive tasks and learning. They're hard to spot unless you're in a math class. 

However, I know that Donald's father is Fred Trump and Fred Trump had five children (including Donald himself). However I know that most of Donald's siblings are actually well educated and of at least average intelligence (which is enough to do well in law school or college). I know that genetics is like a lottery but I was kinda stumped since it seemed like Barron Trump, Tiffany Trump, Ivanka Trump and maybe even Eric are actually of at least average intelligence. It seemed like Donald is the only one in the family that is actually that dumb (although I know that Trump Jr and Eric occasionally says dumb things).",39753835,11042.731944444444,0.7416198487095663,"What do you think caused Donald Trump to have a below average IQ?

Are shower rules normal?,r0oyrg,1,0.56,1637706165,1654469251,"Sorry for long post, and this was written on mobile so weird formatting.

For context, I am a senior in high school, and I skipped a grade, and my mom can be a bit of a pushover when it comes to my dad. (Makes it so rules are absolute and her word means less than his to him)

I (16M, trans) have had shower rules, that my dad created, for as long as I can remember. I live with my mom (42F) my brother (19M) and my dad (40M), the rules so as such. No showers when parents aren’t home, no showers without permission, no showers when parents aren’t home even with mom’s permission, bo showers longer than 10 minutes with a thirty second allowance for the water to warm up, and no showers after 10:30 (recently added about a month ago after he wanted to use the bathroom at around 10:45pm, but I was in the shower). We used to live paycheck to paycheck, and oil wasn’t easy, but that has since changed and we are pretty comfortable, everyone in the house works, and me and my brother buy our own things now. I take showers on days I have work, I am currently getting my permit so I have to shower before my parents get home at around 4:40, since I have work at 5pm. So, I decided that if I can shower on work days and have them stay 10 minutes (you cant shower when he’s not home because he times you while you are in there, even if you have your own timer), then I should be responsible enough to do it when I don’t have work. I usually take them early in the day and dry the bottom of the shower so he doesn’t know I took one regardless, today I left my towel hanging in the bathroom. He got angry at me and when I tried to explain my how work day vs. not work day thing, he just talked over me. Do other households do this? And if not how do I go about giving him my reasoning to stop?",16763086,4656.412777777778,0.7483314773547883,"Are shower rules normal? Sorry for long post, and this was written on mobile so weird formatting.

For context, I am a senior in high school, and I skipped a grade, and my mom can be a bit of a pushover when it comes to my dad. (Makes it so rules are absolute and her word means less than his to him)

I (16M, trans) have had shower rules, that my dad created, for as long as I can remember. I live with my mom (42F) my brother (19M) and my dad (40M), the rules so as such. No showers when parents aren’t home, no showers without permission, no showers when parents aren’t home even with mom’s permission, bo showers longer than 10 minutes with a thirty second allowance for the water to warm up, and no showers after 10:30 (recently added about a month ago after he wanted to use the bathroom at around 10:45pm, but I was in the shower). We used to live paycheck to paycheck, and oil wasn’t easy, but that has since changed and we are pretty comfortable, everyone in the house works, and me and my brother buy our own things now. I take showers on days I have work, I am currently getting my permit so I have to shower before my parents get home at around 4:40, since I have work at 5pm. So, I decided that if I can shower on work days and have them stay 10 minutes (you cant shower when he’s not home because he times you while you are in there, even if you have your own timer), then I should be responsible enough to do it when I don’t have work.

Am I a pedophile,numfy0,2,0.6,1623097100,1654469251,Alright this is going to be long so bear with me. I am 19 years old and have had thoughts that make me feel as if I’m a pedophile. This has only entered my mind in the past couple years and has only increased. I would say it started when I was 16 years old I had nudes on my old iPod of girls from 8th grade so I would say the girls would be 14. I would masturbate to these pictures and find pleasure in them. After I would orgasm I would suddenly be filled with guilt. One day I deleted them all so I didn’t have to have the burden of using them to get off. I reverted to watching step sister pornography preferably the younger looking girls. This became my new habit because it included something as terrible as incest and a younger girl. Let me make one thing clear I only can find teenagers attractive. Like I’ve never looked at a 8 year old and thought unfaithful things. At 18 years old I started dating a 16 year old we have been together since we are 19 and 17. The sex was great and we both soon became obsessed with it. Everytime we see eachother we have sex multiple times. After a while I noticed instead of having sex with her as my girlfriend I would get off by pretending she was my younger sister or just thinking of her as 16 and not my girlfriend. This i still do and feel extremely guilty afterwards. I have even avoided sex knowing I may think these thoughts. One day I decided enough was enough and had sex with her with the intention of her being my girlfriend. It took longer to orgasm but I felt amazing after like a weight was lifted from my chest. Unfortunately I reverted back to my old way of thinking during sex. I’ve had 3 instances where I’ve had sick thoughts. First being at a coffee shop a mother and her daughter were standing in line next to me. If I had to guess the daughter would have been 12 or 13 you could tell her boobs were just coming in and her butt was starting to show. I found this attractive and immediately shut it down and left. The second incident I was driving behind a school bus. I do not know if it was a high school bus or middle school. A edgy girl got off that was clearly not above the age of 16 and I found her extremely attractive. I even rolled down my window and complimented her outfit. Again I felt like a fucking creep. The last time was today I had gone to my old high school to pay off book dept. while I was standing in line a small edgy girl walked out of her classroom and was checking out a computer. I couldn’t help but stare at her and I noticed her staring back in a good way we kept making eye contact. As much as I wanted to ask for her number and talk to her I stopped myself knowing it would be a wrong thing to do. I’m beyond terrified of becoming a monster and am considering killing myself.,31372151,8714.486388888889,1.0954451150103321,Am I a pedophile Alright this is going to be long so bear with me.

The list could go on forever with so many things which kill and harm far more people.  Why aren't people rioting about those things, but they are rioting about this one man?"

I mean If they started back the draft, and included women, women would be protesting saying it was there choice, and didn't have to do it BUT men do...

1: Being a stay at home parent is the norm for their gender.

2: they're never expected to do manual labor.

3: women have the privilege of blaming inappropriate behavior on hormones.

4: women have the privilege of being innocent until proven guilty, when being accused of rape or sexual assault,

5: women have the privilege in thinking only men have privileges.

6: only body shaming for women is acknowledged and fought against.

7: sometimes given free stuff because someone finds them attractive.

8: Women only scholarships.

9: 99% of the time always get the children in a divorce.

10: all they have to do is point at a man, and say rape and he will be locked up, with no proof.

11: Steal a mans sperm then sue him for child support.

12: rape an underage boy, then sue for child support.

13: in California a woman can declare any man as the father of her child, and that child will legally become his responsibility.

14: you can't shame women for being fat or having a small butt or breasts, but its ok to shaming men for being bald, fat and having a small penis.

"Reddit, a guy just hit my parked car in a subdivision and when the cops came I was cited for illegally parking. Am I at fault here?",syzsm,2,0.55,1335748417,1654469247,"A few details out of the way: I have insurance, although it’s just liability. He has full coverage.

------------------------------------
**UPDATE** *so it looks like that if your car is hit while parked, and you're not in it, the other person's insurance has to return the car to the state it was in prior to the accident. This is regardless of legal parking, full coverage, liability, etc. I'm getting estimates tomorrow and all should be well soon.*

-------------------------------------

So my girlfriend lives in a small subdivision, and as I’ve experienced in many subdivisions, people park on the side of the rode when the driveway has too many cars or just in general because you don’t want to park people in. There isn’t a single sign in the subdivision that says “No Parking.” So there my car was, parked on the side of the road. I’m out back of the house when I hear brakes squeal followed by a slam. I walk around the front to see a Student Driver car right behind my vehicle, except there is no student in it. The instructor actually hit my car. I walk over to talk to him and we’re both friendly, he feels bad, we exchange information, and he calls 911. The dispatcher says that it’s a private subdivision so cops can’t be dispatched there, and that our insurance companies would just handle it. Fine. He lives right across the street so I wasn’t worried about him disappearing. I take plenty of photos, making sure to capture both cars, the damage, plates, you name it.


When he goes home and I walk inside I hear from my girlfriend’s father that this isn’t a private subdivision, so I then call the cops myself and they ask me the same thing. “Is this a private subdivision?” I say that I’m not sure so they look it up and no, it’s not. They then said that they’d send out an officer.
Thirty minutes later two officers show up and ask to see my license, see the car, and then ask for registration. I look for the registration but realize that it’s at home. Silly mistake on my part, but I did offer them my insurance card. They didn’t take it. They ask what happened and I explained, then the driver of the other car comes outside and walks over. They get his story which goes something like:


“*Well I was coming around the corner..*” (I look over to look at that corner because if memory served me right it was like 80 yards away, in a 25mph area) “*..and I must have been playing with my radio because blah blah hit his car.*” Officers go back to their car to do some stuff and the guy tells me how he feels terrible again and that I could always go to the small claims court and file against the name of the company he drives for, because it’s their car and their insurance policy. Cops come back out and hand him his license back and he goes on his way home. They go back to the car and tell me it’ll just be a bit. Fifteen minutes later they BOTH get out and I realize at this point that something must be wrong, and I’m thinking back wondering if I’ve done anything wrong and just forgot about it. They hand me my license and say that they’re going to have to cite me for illegally parking. They say how I’m not to park on the side of the road and I can go to court to appeal and that was that. Oh and on the citation they wrote “no insurance” with the warning checkbox checked, which is crazy because I even offered it to them.


I’m not sure what my liability will cover, but furthermore I don’t know what happens if this is all my fault. Right now I’m regretting calling the cops. I would have truthfully been better off not calling them. Even the other guy said that I did nothing wrong parking there and that it was completely his fault. I don’t think anyone living in that subdivision knew that it was illegal to park on the side of the road.


**TL;DR** A guy hit my parked car in a subdivision and I was cited. I have liability and being in a no fault state I was going to go to a small claims court, but seeing as this is now my fault I don’t think I have many options.


Any thoughts, Reddit? Sorry for the long post, I'm just so stressed out right now. Finals are this week and now I have this on my plate.

**EDIT** I forgot to include any details on what the state of my car is. [Here are some images of the incident](http://imgur.com/a/DXclc#0). I'm the car with the hanging bumper, which I suppose is obvious.

I've never partaken, never gotten high, but what I've noticed is that of the friends and people I know who do, they think they are so completely enlightened both during, after and before getting high.

Is this just denial?

Is this need to justify themselves and their act just a response to the fact that it is currently illegal (at least where I am) and thus need to make it seem as though it is a positive experience that the 'big brother' is just trying to stop?

Or do they simply not realize how (usually) slow, usually uninterested in the world around them and dimwitted they can be while high?

I mean this as no offense, but really I'm just curious and unfortunately when I ask friends up here, the response I get is that I'm wrong and I just don't understand. They refuse to see how they are, or perhaps they don't see how they are, or it's a defense mechanism.

How do I tell one of my best friends this...,18k194,0,0.5,1360894057,1654469244,"I'm a college student, and one of my good friends, for these purposes we shall call him Adam, wants to be a dentist.

Currently he is doing DECENT in school (maintaining a 3.0) and recently got 40th or so percentile on his DAT.

Here's where the problem lies: Adam is probably one of the laziest sacks of shit I've met. He naps during the day, hardly goes to class, drinks maybe 3 times a week, and is your typical lazy kid that tries to glide through college. In everything that he has done since I've known him, he's VERY last minute, and unprepared.

examples: 

* he saved a lab to do maybe 2 hours before class started and asked a couple of friends for help because he didn't know how to do some of it.
* Adam was supposed to write a little speech for something, and literally 10 minutes before asked me to help him think of what to say, when he was CLEARLY supposed to write one beforehand.
* Does not help with weekly chores (cleaning, shopping, cooking, etc.)
* Started studying for the DAT the first time TWO weeks before his exam day.

My friends and I joke about taking this test and seeing how we do if we didn't even study and would beat him.

anyway I think you get the point...

I'm not sure if it's just because I happen to be more ambitious or self motivated than he is, but I really think he is on a destructive pathway for life. Every time I try to yell at him or talk to him about being lazy, he just brushes it off, or he'll just get really aggravated. If he somehow read this and figured out who I was, he probably would get really mad at me for worrying. I don't think he realizes that he has a problem of some sort. 

Other than all of this, he's a really great kid, funny, and cool to hang out with.

So I was talking to my friend about their dog, and they had mentioned that it was 5 years old. So I made the casual comment that it was 35 years old in human years, referring to the popular idea that dogs age 7 times faster than human. They then object and say that it is actually 5 years old in human years and 35 years old in dog years. 

Because of this, I've began asking friends the following scenario: ""A dog was born five years ago. How many dog years does it have and how many human years does it have?"" The point of this question is to figure out how people define ""dog years"" and ""human years"". 

Personally, when I say a dog has 5 dog years and 35 human years, I mean that the dog is 5 years old and it has a health equivalent to a 35 year old human. By wording it in this way, I associate ""dog years"" to the actually number of years it has existed and ""human years"" to a number that indicates its health as seen in the human perspective.

Like at all!",ia4sed,0,0.5,1597485884,1654469239,"Why did he loose interest? This is actually a shorter version of my earlier question (u can read that one on my profile) i specifically joined reddit for this issue. I need to know. Really need to know!

I am 30 (Kenyan, African chic) living in Berlin where i relocated to be with my 34 year old (German European guy) husband of almost 4 years. We decided to part ways. It just wasn't working (reasons stated in earlier post) It had been great but slowly deteriorated over time. 

However we are still legally married coz of the permits i need to sort out (work, immigration etc.) So i can finally move out to an apartment which i already booked and we can then officially divorce. In the meantime we date other people.

So met this older hotter guy (48 German European) on a dating site. Most exciting man i have ever been with in my life hands down! It's been like 4 months and it feels sooo fresh still. 

Nice coffee dates, walks at the park, chilling at the lake, kissing in his car, at the movies, steamy make out sessions (TMI's on previous post🤦🏽‍♀️) We make out alot AND WE BOTH FREAKING LOVE IT! Oh my gosh!

But we are waiting for my situation to clear up so we can finally have sex in an apartment properly so not randomly and messy! We want it on a bed! Not drunken and sloppy but sober and mature. We both agreed to that. (His apartment situation explained in earlier post. Almost similar to mine but soon getting resolved) We also don't want to fuck in a motel! It's iish-iish!

So anyway we text all night, share secrets, share our dreams, sexting is soooo hot (we are just born porn stars 😆) we adore one another. He is also very smart (loves history, politics and global governance) and i am usually impressed at how much he knows about the East African region coz frankly alot of folks here assume ""Africa is a country at war"" (never mind that it's a continent 😒), we all still live in huts and can't read or write 🙄 Malaria is everywhere 😒 So annoying!

So it's always very refreshing how informed he is. He is just the right mix of everything (older bad boy, can be very dirty when we make out just the way i like it 😋 did NOT judge me when i asked him to choke me as he kissed & fingered me TMI i know 🤦🏽‍♀️ but NO JUDGEMENT! Also promised to try alot of things i suggested once we have sex, no judgement there either even to the most ""shocking"" requests like tying me up. He was actually excited. Can be very sweet and reliable to me). He leaves work, calls me for a walk with him, weekends we might go out drinking in the city, he hugs me alot, i like it when we hug. He promised to get me a dog. I mean it was all perfect!

Why did he slowly pull away?????? This is killing me!!! SERIOUSLY WHY DID HE DO THAT??????? Why hurt me??????

Also later after i fucked up (faked i was seeing someone else after i noticed he pulled away just to get his full attention through jealousy. More details on previous post) he legit blocked me after that 🤷🏽‍♀️ (details on previous post) but will he unblock me and come back????? He constantly said we have a connection. This guy was going to be my husband, i feel it in my gut. Sometimes he whispered little sweet things on the bus like ""We will make the most beautiful mixed daughter ever!"" 

SO WHY??????? CAN SOMEONE TELL ME PLEASE BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS THIS SAD. I FEEL LIKE CANCELLING THE APARTMENT AND MOVING TO MUNICH OR EVEN OUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IN LIKE A QUIET TOWN IN BAVARIA AWAY FROM BERLIN JUST OUT OF HURT. IT HURTS SO BAD!

Was I wrong for lashing out at my gay friend for confessing their feelings to me?,imx6qg,0,0.48,1599291782,1654469230,"
I met this young gay guy through a mutual female friend. She introduced us to each other because apparently she thought we'd make good friends because me and him have similar interests.
 
He was very funny and seemed confident in himself. Me and him would often hang out with our other friends together or sometimes spend time alone, whenever we did we would watch anime, play videos games or just talk about stuff. He had a androgynous appearance and I teased him playfully about it and he'd tease me back. He was also very good at cooking and always made me my favorite meals whenever he got the chance. 

time passed and nothing interesting happened until one day he asked me if he could speak to me in private. He looked and sounded very nervous which was a little surprising since he often seems very confident. He proccded to tell me how he always thought I was beautiful and asked me If he could take me somewhere fun. 

I was in fucking shock and at a loss for words. I felt a sudden surge of anger and disgust. 

Does this guy really think I am capable of being with another dude? 

I got upset and told him if he was serious and If this was a prank or something. After some more words I called him disgusting and told him to NEVER speak to me again and how disappointing I was because he seemed like such a great friend. He looked like he was about to cry and after some more words I left. 

And obviously the conversation was a lot more detailed and longer but due to character limit I can't put it here. 

A few days later our mutual friend talked me and she was fucking furious. She said was I said was disgusting and mean I should be flattered a good looking guy like him asked me out. She then said I should've at least rejected him nicely and that I made him cry a LOT. I replied by saying he should get his facts right and find out If a guy is gay first. 

I will admit he was VERY good looking. As I said he had an androgynous appearance. His face was very pretty and he was always very nicely dressed. His body was also fit like mine.  

But no matter how good looking a guy is. I. AM. NOT. INTO. GUYS. Period. I dont how care how pretty they are.

The thing is i always get hit on by gay and I've been asked out by other gay guys as well and I don't fucking understand why or how to prevent this shit. It makes me feel less masculine and worry if I look or give off gay vibes. I struggle with mental health issues and gay people scare me and I feel very uncomfortable around them.

Back then I was in the heat of moment...but now I feel so fucking bad and guilty about what I said to my gay friend. He has such a innocent appearance and he was so nice to me. Hes a good guy but I am a  scared of gay people and find them abnormal.

The moment I saw her, I felt that I have to be with her, so contrary to my introvert image, I approached her and asked her name and booked a meeting with her for some course doubts. Although I ace the course, I still wanted to meet her so I made up random doubts and asked her. This happened for couple of times and I added her on facebook. After a few chats I got to know that she loves action movies (made me fall for her even more :D), so I asked her out for a movie for Valentine's day evening, she refused by saying that she has to go for a party at a friends house and this term she is writing her thesis so she is a bit busy, but she thanked me for asking her :S

I felt immense anxiety through my veins, and thought I would give up on her as clearly she is not interested! But I could not  focus on other things, so i tried to talk to her again, found out that she is looking for a job and since she doesn't have North American Work experience she is facing problems. Now because of my internships I had some contacts so I said I could help her out and she said sure, now I have got her an interview from a big company. We met a couple of times after that (mainly attending company info sessions) and chatted for a good 5-6 days everyday before going to bed, talking about each other.
She asked about my school project and was impressed and asked if she could join it for some experience, as expected I agreed :P
I have my exams these days so I can't really get to meet her, but I plan to meet her to prepare for her interview and explain my project in more details to her.
I have tried a lot in hinting her that I REALLY REALLY LIKE HER, but I am not sure how much did she understand! I even did not sleep for 30+ hours so that I could do my midterm studying and help her out for getting an interview (ofcourse she doesn't know :P), hence I know I am very much in love with her :D I even started learning mandarin and watching mandarin shows!

Justification for Equal Pay Act?,s4anb,0,0.45,1334151458,1654469228,"Hi Reddit,

Can you help me craft an argument in favor of equal pay act?  I’ve been arguing with my husband, he’s against it, and I’d like to present you with his argument and maybe you can help me defend mine.  I caught myself sounding like a baby *”Because its not faiiirrrrrr”* so I’d like facts and solid points to argue against the below

1)	 When a company offers you a salary, they’re not only considering the work you currently do, but also future profitability/potential you have w/in the firm.  Statistically, women are way more likely to defect from the work force than men are.  Therefore, females are not as valuable as men to the company, because men are more likely to generate future earnings.

2)	Alternatively, instead of thinking of it as “docking women’s pay,” doesn’t a company have the right to pay a premium for an employee who is likely to be a better earner.    Especially in a large company (say 250,000 employees), the firm can run significant statistics on who are the most valuable employees to the firm over time.  Don’t they have a right to pay a premium to keep those employees?

3)	Replacement costs are a major expense for a company.   Companies are allowed to discriminate against other certain types of employees when hiring because of the potential costs they carry (for example, yellow card employees can be very expensive to have on staff because of the high turnover rate).  


My response was along the lines of “Sure, but the company doesn’t know if I am or am not going to have kids, let alone if it will affect my work potential, so why should I be docked for what might happen just because I have a uterus”  the response to that was “We base decisions on probability all of the time.  There is a reason horses have different odds in the race – some are more likely to succeed than others.  “

So reddit… help me justify why equal pay acts should exist.  If i am in the wrong subreddit, yell at me about it.

Need advice: So I had sex with my best friend's younger sister.  Except there's a problem...,y3h4a,0,0.5,1344786583,1654469227,"So my best friend's (Allan) little sister (Kim) and I have always been flirty with each other.  However, things had never advanced beyond second base because, for as long as I've known Kim she's been underage (or just too young to mess with).  Well, Allan had been out of the states for over three years and I had not seen Allan or Kim since Allan left.  Last weekend, Allan returns back to the states and I head home for a night of celebration and inebriation.  Only this time, Kim is now a gorgeous 20 year old woman.

The night is filled with fun and good times.  It gets late and I end up in Kim's bed and we do our thing.  FINALLY, I get to taste the nectar of this beautifully blossomed flower.

The morning comes and Kim pulls me over her for some more sexy times.  I'm so hungover at this point I just pull my shorts down a little, using the base of my scrot as a place holder for the waist band of my shorts.  The hangover gets to me and I'm only able to go about a minute before I demount.  But this time...something wasn't right.  

I begin to smell a scent unlike any scent I've smelt before.  No, it was not the dreaded stankfish.  This smell was...metallic.  Like...copper.  Like the scent of a thousand pennies.  My face puckered and my eyelids began blinking like I was walking upwind a desert sand storm.  I was confused.  I stumble out the room and as daylight hits my body I see a dark red streak lining the front of my shorts.  I walk to my car to change and head back inside to rid myself of this ore-like odor.  Soap is no match.  I had to wash ""myself"" with GoJo twice to get the scent out.  I think 20% of my penis went with it.

In any case, I haven't talked to Kim since this unfortunate event.  I was supposed to hangout with her the following day but have been purposely avoiding her.  I know for a fact that I will be seeing this girl again in person several more times in the future.  How the hell do I handle this Reddit?  I really like this girl. I think she's expecting to hook up again but I don't know if I can brush this aside and risk my sense of smell and self-worth be attacked like that again.  I know you guys can figure out a win-win solution.  I've got faith in Reddit.  HALP!

Can Reddit help me find my life's purpose?,yxha8,0,0.5,1346108811,1654469227,"Hello,

As the title suggests, I'm having trouble finding my life's purpose. Writing isn't my strong suit so bare with me as I try to get all this out.

I'm in my mid 30's. Have been on disability for anxiety and panic disorder. Meds haven't really helped. I have bouts of anxiety daily. This isn't who I am, though you can argue I've let become an identity.

I've tried attending school in the past but didn't get very far, nor finish.

I have a family (wife and kids) and my wife is the main source of income. I'd like to change that as I know it's taken a toll on her mentally.

I want to find my purpose in life, but don't know where to look. 

My interests include:

* health: yoga, self-help, alternative medicine
* herbs: put me in an herb shop and I'd spend days there
* art: ceramics, printmaking, screen printing. This is what I went to school for but didn't finish. I can't draw to save my life and throwing pots wasn't my thing either. I love design and typography (though I have no education in either).
* I like using my hands and building things
* someone suggested I become a counselor because I'm a good listener and problem solver. 

I'm all over the place as you can see. I doubt this will get very far, but feel free to offer up advice or ask questions for clarity. 

Vocational school is where I might be heading. I'm going to look into them but I know Reddit rips schools like ITT Tech because they're a waste of money.

Are vaginas seen as more gross in society and by more people than penises are? Truthful honest answers please.,izk237,0,0.5,1601042859,1654469225,"I read about women who say men don't want to give oral cause they think it's gross.

Then there are no equivalents to ""fishy"" ""beef flaps"" ""axe wound"" ""ham sandwich"" ""punched lasagna"" used to describe penises in a negative way.

"Reddit, What are your pooping habits?",jzidu,0,0.45,1314742488,1654469221,"I've been thinking alot about pooping lately and have some questions for the reddit populous on pooping. I am providing my answers to the questions as well

**- How many times a day do you poop?**
I usually poop once, sometimes twice if I have eaten McDonald's

**- Do you like looking at your poops, comparing them to past poops or such?**
I always look at my poop, I am really just looking for undigested corn kernels or something I can identify.

**- Do you poop at a regular time(s) every day?**
I did when I had a 9-5, but now that I don't I poop whenever I goddamn please

**- Do you care where you poop (private vs public bathroom)?**
I usually try to poop in a private bathroom and can usually hold it until I get to one, but I refuse to shit myself so when in dire need I will succumb to germy butt.

**- Have you ever found anything in your poop that is not food?**
I haven't but am waiting for one of those hangover poops to shit out something extraordinary.

**- Largest Poop?**
I was at the MoMa in NYC a couple of months ago and I *shit* you not I had two loafs each one around a foot long followed by a lot of little poop balls.

**- Extreme pain when pooping?**
I once felt like I was ripping my anus open for a gargantuan turd once upon of time, I was worried, although I saw no blood.

**- Have you ever pooped yourself (sharts do not count)?**
I have never pooped myself but I can imagine it would be quite a thrilling experience, probably feel pretty good having that warm brown goop stuck to your but, although the smell would be awful.

**- Have you ever sharted yourself?**
I sharted at work once, it sucked, I ran home real fast to clean up, the shart looked orangeish against my white boxer briefs.

**- Have you ever touched your own poop?**
When I was little and being potty trained I grabbed one of my turds, my mom was not impressed.

**- When wiping do you wad up the toilet paper or fold it over?**
You are a dumbass if you fold. Why fold something you are just going to smother in shit and flush down a series of tubes?

**- What is the weirdest place you've shat?**
I shat in a porta potty once, it was a traumatic experience.

**- When you poop, do you always pee?**
I always pee when I poop, even if its a little, I think it would be impossible for me to try and not piss while shitting.

**- Is the water splashing your ass a good or bad thing?**
Always a bad thing for me, considering I have probably already pissed in the water (see above)

**- Any weird stories or habits you would like to share about your pooping?**
I for one sometimes look between my legs to the reflection in the water of my ass, sometimes I can see the silhouette of the turn coming out of my anus.

Why don't people believe my story about how my friends all died?,p0hbaf,0,0.5,1628438543,1654469220,"We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise . . . also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound, and a deep, dumb-sounding voice calling out ''Imma comin, beany boooooy!''.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine, followed by that deep voice again, saying ''you took Beany booooy!''. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water... 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 10 feet long, green, and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a purple dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time, and on its eyes were three long purple eyelashes. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. My poor comrades were never to be seen again.

I suffered a perpetual mental breakdown until the airing of Beany and Cecil (Bob Clampett cartoon) had stopped, 3 months later. However, I am forever disturbed by what I saw back when I was a teenager. I've become a member of every single paranormal forum.

Do men like and enjoy a loud and enthusiastic woman in bed?,io65gl,4,0.56,1599479879,1654469218,"So im 18 and my bf is almost 19 and i LOVE having sex with him. He turns ALL of my button on.

We just started dating and he lives 2 hours away so this was only the second time weve had a change to meet up, which was yesterday.

I want to tell her to shave that shit off; it annoys the crap out of me whenever I talk to her or go to meetings because I just end up staring at it, losing my concentration.

I'm liking the feedback. I definitely see how it's ""wrong"" but I don't see how it's offensive. I don't find it offensive at all if someone asks me where I'm from and nor do I assume they are suggesting I don't belong in Canada either.

I've traveled to a lot of European countries, where I expect ignorance, and I get assumed a certain race. I find that much more offensive. I'm Melanesian(Fijian), but when people assume I'm West Indian, or South Asian I find that way worse.

For those saying, white people never get asked that question. That is completely untrue, and you cannot speak for every white person in North America. I've seen this question asked amongst some construction sites, even amongst my friends. Let's not forget Italians, Irish, Portuguese and Slavic people are all ""white"" as well.

I do understand it's the context as well... like if someone said ""where are you from?"" in a distasteful way, then yeah you can assume the worst. However, if it's some bubbly white person, you cannot possibly assume this person means the worst, they're just genuinely interested in where you're from.

In the debate I was fortunate to have been the only one who's traveled outside of North America a lot and I was able to say, ""when you go abroad, you get to say you're Canadian and have people satisfied with that answer, but when you're in Canada everyone knows you're not *Just Canadian* (unless you're indigenous)

I'm liking the feedback. I definitely see how it's ""wrong"" but I don't see how it's offensive. I don't find it offensive at all if someone asks me where I'm from and nor do I assume they are suggesting I don't belong in Canada either.

I've traveled to a lot of European countries, where I expect ignorance, and I get assumed a certain race. I find that much more offensive. I'm Melanesian(Fijian), but when people assume I'm West Indian, or South Asian I find that way worse.

For those saying, white people never get asked that question. That is completely untrue, and you cannot speak for every white person in North America. I've seen this question asked amongst some construction sites, even amongst my friends. Let's not forget Italians, Irish, Portuguese and Slavic people are all ""white"" as well.

I do understand it's the context as well... like if someone said ""where are you from?"" in a distasteful way, then yeah you can assume the worst. However, if it's some bubbly white person, you cannot possibly assume this person means the worst, they're just genuinely interested in where you're from.

In the debate I was fortunate to have been the only one who's traveled outside of North America a lot and I was able to say, ""when you go abroad, you get to say you're Canadian and have people satisfied with that answer, but when you're in Canada everyone knows you're not *Just Canadian* (unless you're indigenous)

"Why is it that the ruder I am to people, the better they treat me?",qwpqko,197,0.91,1637242155,1654469206,"22y/o female here.

Got sick of everyone treating me like garbage and calling me weak - so I decided to stop being kind and understanding.

Once I did that, everyone started being nice to me. Teachers, bosses , friends , etc.

Do people like being treated like shit?

I hate being this way. But it’s the only way I can be treated properly. 

Once I began doing this - everyone was like in disbelief that I was capable of doing that. Because I come across as soft and nice. So when I put my foot down (and i’m very very good with words) people seemed to be intimidated by me & probably started treating me nicer because they don’t want to be embarrassed.

Problem is, I always hated when people treated me that way. And I feel a tremendous amount of guilt. Even though no one apologized or felt guilty when I was on the receiving end of their BS.

I am better at being a bitch than them , and they realize that. It kinda makes me feel good in the moment, to see the shock on people’s faces & to see how quickly their behaviour changes toward me.

But I don’t want to be a “Karen” I want to be nice and soft. But nobody likes me when I’m like that. It’s really exhausting. 

Why are people like this? Why must I have to be a bitch in order for others to have decency toward me? I just want to be nice & be treated nice in return. Why do I have to play these mind games?

Also, being a bitch doesn’t come naturally to me. I just started behaving this way this year, because I am angry. I’m angry at the fact that people overlook me, take advantage of me, and abandon me.

I even noticed a change in romantic encounters. Men say they don’t like bitches - but they do!! Men love it when I step all over them. Just like how “women love assholes”

Is it because they want to gain my approval? Is it like a sense of accomplishment for them? Because complimenting them and baking them brownies brought me nothing.

Is this woman out of line for following my kids home so she could teach them a lesson?,qioar5,238,0.96,1635547473,1654469201,"I need someone to either validate me or talk me down over this lady's interaction with my kids.  I'm pretty pissed, but maybe I'm overreacting.

My 17yo son drives himself and my 14yo son to school & back daily.  Today, they bring a couple of other boys because...Friday night.  When they pull in I see another car in the driveway and my younger son is talking to the driver and he waves me out.  Probably a parent dropping off and wanting to fact-check as they sometimes do.  

I head out & hear my son say, ""You can talk to my mom, here she comes.""  It's some woman no one knows that starts off, ""I was hoping to not get a parent involved, but to let these older boys be mature and have a teaching moment.""  My guard goes up.  She was never nasty and never raised her voice, but she starts in about how they were ""flying down the road at 45mph...I couldn't even catch them!!...""  She seems to think my younger son was the driver and he cuts in (yes, he has the mouth of a teenage boy).  She tries to talk at him and over him, but I shut that down and send all the kids inside.  I tell her I'll talk to them.  That should do it.  

She continues on again about the ""flying...45mph...I was trying to...but they start with the \*makes the talking motion with her hands and the blah blah-like sounds\* because they're teenagers.""  ""Yes, I know they're teenagers. I live with them.  I'll talk to them.""  She keeps going about ""...if hadn't been a teacher once..."" I'm not really hearing her anymore.  ""I'll talk to them."" and she finally leaves.  

Of course, I will talk to them.  Now, not to be ""that mom"", but my oldest is a great driver.  He's my teetotalling, rule-following, no-risk kid.  But he is a teenager and there was a carful and I'm sure the energy was high.  He's actually chuckling as he tells me they were behind her on a 2 lane, 65mph road and she was going about 45 the entire way.  She turns on to the street to our house (where she claims they were flying at 45mph) and drives 20.  The speed limit on that road IS 45MPH!!!   (We live somewhat rural.) So, in a completely legal move, my son passes her on the left and continues on.  That's his whole story which the other kids back up.

I don't think it's cool that she *followed my children home*, into *their* driveway to give them a teachable moment while, as she says, not wanting to get any parents involved.  She didn't know that there would be any parents there or not.  I've looked around at the world and I see a lot of people that I don't want my kids learning anything from.  While I know she's right, I also don't like hearing from her that they were running off at the mouth ""because they're teenagers"".  Here's ""that mom"" again: My kids are generally respectful to other adults, including strangers.  I don't get complaints from anyone else.  This is not a problem we have.  But when a strange woman follows them home and tries to discipline them (teaching moment, my ass), I can't really blame them for being defensive.  

I'm all about teachable moments.  I love them.  But I think those belong to me, their dad, and a select few that we choose.  I also appreciate it if someone is concerned about their safety and I have no problem with other adults speaking directly to them about it.  But I do not like that she followed them home and specifically did not want to involve me.  Is there a better way she could have handled this? 

Am I out of line here to be so pissed off?  It doesn't matter.  She's gone, I talked to my driver and we handled it the way we handle things in our home.  I don't plan on any further action.  But, I'm still just hot about it.

People who aren't taking the vaccine. What are your reasons?,nxqjz8,237,0.92,1623446408,1654469201,"Now I'm not here to slate you, tell you you're wrong or lecture you.

Reasons for refusing are : 

- They've had covid, it wasn't too bad for them and therefore they're less likely to get it again/they now have antibodies.

- Herd immunity.  The ""herd"" take the vaccine.  This makes the spread of disease from person to person less likely.  As a result the whole community become protected.

- Side effects of the vaccine that may become apparent later

- Pregnancy (dont want to risk harm to the baby)

- The Government are trying to control us with fear mongering (basically the ""conspiracy"" reasons)

Because of covid only my parents could see her, I had to take my older sister home and wait until we got word. Eventually my parents came home. Her leg is broken,  so is her hip. She has a brain bleed and she's in the ICU but she's alive. The guy who hit her stopped and called an ambulance and the police. And all I keep thinking is my baby sister got hurt. We never get along but I love her and now her life has to be put on hold cause some jerk wasnt paying attention. She was about to graduate college. She was working so friggin hard.

I can't stop and I don't know why I'm even posting this here but maybe someone else has gone through this and will have some advice.
UPDATE- the doctors say that she's doing well for someone in her condition, her tailbones bruised but she's aware of her surroundings and they took her neck collar off, she's still got the breathing tube in but they said they have to run several tests and see if they can take it out. Ultimately she's gonna pull through and it's gonna be a long road to recovery for her but I intend to be there as much as I can and she has our family and her friends support.

UPDATE- it's been a long week. She's finally gotten off the ventilator and she's awake. She's regressed mentally a little, but given time she should get better. For now we continue to support her.

What drug was this?,r9rj4o,280,0.96,1638744036,1654469197,"I’ll try to keep this Short. My now ex bf pressured me to try 2 small squares of chocolate. He said it was CBD.

Why is it so culturally acceptable to smack kids ?,pnyy4s,320,0.94,1631609222,1654469193,"I (17F) was spanked as a kid, from a wooden spoon from my mum to the slipper from my nana. I’m white English and it’s pretty common where I live. 

The question: 

on social media sites I’m constantly seeing videos/posts of POC kids talking/being hit with a slipper/spanked. I’m currently studying psychology and am planning on going to uni for child psychology, there are HUNDREDS of studies and research papers that show physical discipline doesn’t work, all it does is scare the child and often increases the chance of psychological problems in later life. So I don’t understand why people still defend it? 

The most common defensive I hear is that “it’s their culture” but last I checked culture doesn’t change the formation of the brain? 

But another one I hear is that it’s the only way to get kids to listen? 

I don’t know, I’m confused because the proof is right there, a simple google search will show that parents shouldn’t be smacking their kids yet people till ignore it or try to defend it. 

So like, does anyone know why???

Edit: I do not care nor want your justification for hitting kids. That is not what I’m asking, read the question.

For example, someone posted on an advice forum because they wanted advice on how to deal with their very apparently abusive father. The reddit poster didn't use the words ""abuse,"" but it was very clear to me that their father was verbally and emotionally abusing them. So many comments said things such as, ""stop being a whiny prick"" and ""listen to what your father tells you and stop complaining"" ""you sound dumb."" The poster actually replied to the second comment (about doing what your father tells you), saying something along the lines of, ""I do what he tells me and I even try to go above and beyond to please him but it doesn't stop him from saying mean things to me."" The hateful commenter, ignoring what they said, just commented back ""you're a child, meaning you have to be subservient and do what your father says without complaining about it."" It seemed like a majority of the people in the comments just wanted the poster to accept and take the abuse, which is probably the most terrible advice ever.

Is there a Christian version to rape I'm unaware of?,oh6usq,432,0.91,1625871741,1654469187,"So about a month ago I was over at my parents and I have no idea how this topic came up but we somehow started talking about sex and how we view it. Now with my dad being paralyzed from the waist down since 2014, my parents haven't had sex in a long time. 

Somehow it came of that my mother's philosophy on sex in marriage is that if he ever asked or made advances then, because she was married to him, she was obligated to give it to him whenever. No questions asked and it didn't matter if she was in the mood or not. If he wanted it he got it, and she calls on the bible to back this opinion. 

Now correct me if I'm wrong here but that's is rape... Right?

She was about to the point of yelling at me to defend her point and wanted to me to believe it too. Thankfully I'm in a very happy married relationship and I respect my wife far more that I think that my father did his, but I can't help but think of my 3 sisters that were raised in that same household and grew up with that same mentality. 2 of my sister's now have 5 kids or more, and one has had multiple miscarriages.

How can I make up my mind about getting vaccinated?,p4xpz4,855,0.85,1629048317,1654469177,"This might me a long post, I’ll try to keep it short though. 

I am a 25 year old dude and I am not sure if I should get the vaccine or not. I live with my mom. She is quite a stubborn woman. If she is convinced of something, nothing will change her mind, not even facts. She is right no matter what. She is strongly against the vaccine. She looks up lots of information on it, information I believe to be false. She believes the conspiracy theories that our governments are trying to kill us because of overpopulation. She’s still saying she doesn’t believe corona is real. She has a friend who’s daughter has gotten vaccinated and my mom is calling her mental. Saying that if she can’t get pregnant anymore a couple of years from now it’ll be her own damn fault. 

I just told her that I’m thinking about getting it and she nearly flipped. She got this psycho look on her face and she said: “great. Do it. Your body. You take it. I won’t. War declared.” Whatever the hell she means by that. 

From a young age I have always let her influence my decisions. I made my choices the way I thought she wanted me to make them. Otherwise “mommy would get mad” or so I believed. And she still does. 

The friend I mentioned earlier, she is acquainted with a doctor. I don’t know what kind. But he tells her a lot about the vaccine, how it’s basically a toxin and how no one should take it. My mom heard this “information” from her friend and instantly believes it. If I send her articles from a trusted source with factual evidence, she disregards it. Because it doesn’t fit the narrative she has in her head. If I’d send her a bogus article about the virus being fake she’d believe it in a heartbeat. 

She keeps planting seeds of doubt in my head, regarding this decision and many other unrelated ones. Always warning me about dangers that don’t even exist. She’s overly protective, always has been. But I also see her as controlling. 

I have trouble making decisions on my own. Always need to ask others what they’d do. I think that’s because of how she raised me. I always have doubts until someone else takes them away. 

So pretty long post summed up: should I take the vaccine or not? Because I’m afraid of the side effects it might have in a couple of years, and I’m afraid of the effects it will have on my already strained relationship with my mom. We still live together so I want to keep that “pleasant”. What do you think I should do?",25420860,7061.35,26.95830113341714,"How can I make up my mind about getting vaccinated?

I just told her that I’m thinking about getting it and she nearly flipped. She got this psycho look on her face and she said: “great. Do it. Your body. You take it. I won’t. War declared.” Whatever the hell she means by that. 

From a young age I have always let her influence my decisions. I made my choices the way I thought she wanted me to make them. Otherwise “mommy would get mad” or so I believed. And she still does. 

The friend I mentioned earlier, she is acquainted with a doctor. I don’t know what kind. But he tells her a lot about the vaccine, how it’s basically a toxin and how no one should take it. My mom heard this “information” from her friend and instantly believes it. If I send her articles from a trusted source with factual evidence, she disregards it. Because it doesn’t fit the narrative she has in her head. If I’d send her a bogus article about the virus being fake she’d believe it in a heartbeat. 

She keeps planting seeds of doubt in my head, regarding this decision and many other unrelated ones. Always warning me about dangers that don’t even exist. She’s overly protective, always has been. But I also see her as controlling. 

I have trouble making decisions on my own. Always need to ask others what they’d do. I think that’s because of how she raised me. I always have doubts until someone else takes them away. 

So pretty long post summed up: should I take the vaccine or not? Because I’m afraid of the side effects it might have in a couple of years, and I’m afraid of the effects it will have on my already strained relationship with my mom. We still live together so I want to keep that “pleasant”. What do you think I should do?"

Im about to join the military in a couple of years and i do not like getting yelled at,qc1n78,900,0.91,1634738709,1654469177,Any advice?,19730468,5480.685555555556,28.61817604250837,Im about to join the military in a couple of years and i do not like getting yelled at Any advice?
I’m pretty sure my best friend is a manipulative narcissist.. I need advice. Can’t believe she did this..,qyvi0h,924,0.94,1637503068,1654469177,"So I’m a 25 yo female, recently started working at a bank. This is where I met Lisa. Lisa is 21 years old, a beautiful girl and we vibed immediately. We were the only two girls at the bank who go out of our way to look good and we do get a lot of attention.

We kind of look alike, both have black hair, blue eyes, and we also have a similar body shape, both are busty, wide hips, small waist. She is a little chubbier than me and has a bit of a belly and thicker arms but both the same height (I’m 5’3 she’s 5’3 1/2). You may be thinking, why are these details important- you’ll find out why in a second. 

When I first met Lisa, she told me she was Russian.. because I’m middle eastern, I kind of felt a first generation American daughter of immigrants connection. We joked about our immigrant parents’ silly/quirky ways, talked about our language differences, etc. we were inseparable. However, things started taking a turning point. The more I got to know Lisa, the more I started feeling bad about myself..

She would constantly make remarks that sounded mean, but she’d insist she meant it in a sweet way. One time, randomly, she said that she’s taller than me so she appeared thinner and I was “stubby”. I told her that I didn’t really like being called stubby and she kept insisting that she meant it in an adorable way.. bare in mind, she’s only half an inch taller than me but she weighs about 180 and I weigh 140. I have no fat around my waist or arms but she does. 
Whenever we’d be around a group of guys, she’d constantly show them embarrassing videos of me, and laugh as if she’s just joking. I’ve told her many times that I didn’t like when she does that and she’d keep saying that she’d stop.. but she never did.

She’d always act like we were competing over these men.. and would be super aggressive about it.. even though I genuinely was not competing. She loves black men and hates white men. I love white men and whenever there’d be a white guy who would hit on me, she’d get aggressively sexual with him (while her bf is at home).. and because I don’t do that in the first interaction, the guy would then turn his attention to her. She’d take his number and never call him, and then talk about how ugly he was and how she was just “messing around” when hitting on him.

Another time I felt off was when we were watching a movie that had nothing to do with middle Eastern women. She turned and looked at me randomly and said, “I think middle Eastern women are ugly,”. Again- I’m middle Eastern and she knows that. I didn’t argue with her because I felt like maybe she was saying these things because she felt insecure and I felt bad for her, so I let her win that one. It still hurt my feelings that my friend said something like that to me, but whatever. 
A few weeks later we were going to go to her family’s thanksgiving. While we were getting ready, she confessed that she wasn’t Russian of the daughter of immigrants. The entire time she was confessing, she was laughing hysterically as if it was just a “stupid prank”.. 
the issue, however, is that it didn’t seem that way. She didn’t just lie to me, she lied to our entire company, her boyfriend, every guy we’d run into, etc. she even learned the language to come off more convincing 🤦🏻‍♀️

I found out she lied because she wanted to come off as “exotic” and “foreign”, not “boring and white” (her words not mine). She only confessed the truth because I  was meeting her very redneck family of Irish and polish descent. It felt kinda weird but I wasn’t mad, I was more shocked. 

Her backhanded compliments, lies, talking badly about me to our other friend Carlie (who she admitted she didn’t like because Carlie gets more attention than her) continued for months.. until one day I couldn’t take it anymore and confronted her about it. She gaslit me and denied everything.. even after I promised her I wouldn’t get upset if she just is open and honest with me. She insisted it was all in my head and got aggressive with me. Started yellling horrible things at me, like how I deserved my ex breaking my shoulder- and when I started to walk away crying, she started laughing hysterically like a psychopath.

Jump to a few months later, a few weeks ago I felt bad losing her as a friend and tried to reconnect with her. She insisted I apologize and I did. She then invited me to her bday party.. when I got there, there were 20 dudes I didn’t know. I walked in on her playing those same embarrassing videos of me from before.. she says come on in we’re watching you act stupid. 

While they all laughed, I was visibly uncomfortable and upset. She didn’t really care and kept going. Again, after trying to talk to her about it, I was gaslit.

Is this sexual assault or is it normal?,oa5282,2401,0.95,1624960203,1654469173,"I'm sorry if this is a wrong subreddit to ask this question but I don't know where else to ask since this is my first time using this app. Redirect me please if there is another subreddit that could maybe help me more. As I said I've never used Reddit or apps like these but I feel the need to get this off my chest.

Long story short I was left alone with a guy I met for the first time that night on a beach. It was very late(around maybe 3 am) and I was a little drunk since it was after a party. My male friend I've known for a long time and another guy I just met there went for a swim. And now me and this dude were completely alone. The next thing I knew he was on top of me, touching my waist and my breasts. I told him no but he didn't stop. He then tried to kiss me but I pulled away and he tried again. I asked him again if he could please stop and he didn't. He just asked if I was drunk and continued touching me and kissing me on the neck. He's a lot stronger than me as I'm a very small girl and it was hard to push him away. I then got up and told him I was going to the toilet. After I got back my friend was there and we went home.

Is this normal or is it considered sexual assault? My friend told me what was I expecting to happen being left alone with a man and that It was expected to happen. I feel ashamed to tell anyone as I expect the same response.

Edit: I asked because I got told it was normal. I am seeking validation for my feelings. The first thing that came to my mind after it happened was definately that this was sexual assault, but because of my surroundings I started doubting it. I also spent time with him because I trusted my male friend I was with. Them leaving caught me off guard. I'm also 18 yo and he was like 23.
